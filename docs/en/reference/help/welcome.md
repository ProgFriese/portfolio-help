Launching the Portfolio Performance app automatically displays the Welcome page (see Figure 1), along with any portfolios that were open the last time you used the program. You can redisplay the Welcome page (after closing it) via the menu `Help > Welcome`.

On the left-hand side, the Welcome page displays the app version (e.g. 0.79.1 from August 2025), a list of actions such as opening a file or creating a new portfolio file, and a list of recently used files. You can clear this list via the menu `File > Open Recent > Clear List`. The middle section provides a link to open a demo sample file (named *Kommer*) and several links to the documentation website, of which this manual is a part. On the right-hand side, there is a link to download the Portfolio Performance mobile app.
