title: Application/Help menu
---

There are minor differences between the menu systems on macOS and Windows (see Figure 1 for macOS and Figure 2 for Windows). In particular, the Help menu on Windows combines the Application menu **and** the Help menu found on macOS. Additionally, the customisation options are called `Settings` on macOS and `Preferences` on Windows.
